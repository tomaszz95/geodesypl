# Geodesy site

Hello, that's my first completely finished and functional website. 
I work as a land surveyor in a moment of creating the page, so I decided to develop a website for a made-up geodesic company.
The page is created in **Polish language**.

## ðŸ“« Page contains

- main site and two site pages (services and about us),
- custom page 404 and redirects,
- responsible design,
- accessibility practices,
- SEO practices,
- basic design requirements preserved (minimalistic but clean, contrast, colors etc.).

## ðŸ›  Used tools / programming languages / technologies

- HTML / CSS,
- page written in SCSS,
- JavaScript (just a little bit, not a 'heavy JS project' - in contrast to my other project named ToolsKit),
- GULP (code minification, compressing images, support for older browsers),
- git / github.
